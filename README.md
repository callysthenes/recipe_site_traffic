# :fork_and_knife: Recipe Popularity Predictor :fork_and_knife:

In the world of cooking and culinary delights, knowing which recipes will become popular can have a significant impact on website traffic and user engagement. This project aims to predict the popularity of recipes based on a dataset of 1000 recipes, including features such as calories, carbohydrates, sugar, protein, food category, and servings. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can minimize the chance of displaying unpopular recipes on a website, ultimately attracting more visitors.

# :mag: Challenge :mag:

As part of this data-driven project, our goal is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a recipe will be popular or not. We'll use a dataset containing nutritional information, food category, and serving sizes to train and evaluate our models. By predicting recipe popularity, we can curate content to boost user engagement and satisfaction.

# ðŸ’» Work Done So Far ðŸ’»

- **Data Exploration (EDA):** We've started with an in-depth exploration of the dataset, analyzing statistics, and creating visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships between nutritional factors and recipe popularity. The EDA process has allowed us to identify potential features for model development.

- **Data Preprocessing:** To make the data suitable for machine learning, we've performed data cleaning and feature engineering. We've considered the handling of missing data and transformed time-based features to suit our prediction intervals.

- **Model Development:** We've experimented with various machine learning models, including regression and classification algorithms. One of the models we've developed is a binary classifier to predict recipe popularity. This model is an essential step towards creating more sophisticated predictive models in the future.

# :rocket: Future Steps :rocket:

- **Feature Engineering:** We plan to further improve feature engineering, including adding additional data sources that may enhance prediction accuracy.

- **Model Enhancement:** Our next steps involve trying more complex models and fine-tuning model parameters to achieve better predictive performance.

- **User Interface:** In addition to improving the prediction models, we intend to create a user-friendly interface that showcases the popular recipes and allows users to interact with the data.
